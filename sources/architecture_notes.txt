- Currently, assets are identified using their paths as std::strings.
  This is much slower than using integer IDs and is likely the main performance
  bottleneck in our ECS stress tests.

- In the test, each player entity had multiple components, most importantly
  AnimatedDrawable and Drawable components that store many std::string paths.
  Systems update and assign these strings every frame, leading to high CPU cost.

- Stress test results:
  - 1 player: silky smooth 60 FPS
  - 1 onscreen player, 1000 offscreen players: 60 FPS
  - 1 onscreen player, 5000 offscreen players: 56–60 FPS
  - 1 onscreen player, 10000 offscreen players: 34–36 FPS

- Note: The ECS architecture itself (sparse set) is performant;
  the slowdown comes from per-frame string operations in the systems.
